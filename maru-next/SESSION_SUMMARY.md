# End of Session Summary - Dec 7, 2024

## 🚀 Achievements Today
- **Visual Overhaul**: Implemented the "Atmospheric" aesthetic with new cloud wireframe backgrounds across Hero, Service pages, and Navigation Overlay.
- **Navigation Upgrade**: Replaced the old "Spinning Scroll Indicator" with a premium, fixed `PageFrame` (Vertical "HOMEPAGE" & "SCROLL TO TOP" controls).
- **Brand Unification**: Standardized the `IsometricProcess` component to strictly follow the Maru Cyan (`#22d3ee`) theme.
- **Housekeeping**: Successfully removed legacy components (`Dodecahedron`, `ScrollIndicator`) and unused markdown documentation.
- **Code Safety**: All changes successfully pushed to branch `feature/ai-readiness-and-services`.

## 📋 Plan for Tomorrow
1.  **HubSpot Integration**: Finalize form connections and tracking scripts.
2.  **UI Polish**: rigorous styling review (paddings, mobile views, contrast).
3.  **Content Structure**: Augment sections that need better hierarchy or layout.
4.  **Launch**: Prepare for production deployment.
